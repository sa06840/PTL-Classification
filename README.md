# Does your robot know when to cross the road? Published at the 25th IEEE International Multitopic Conference)

In this research project, my team and I focused on enhancing a robotâ€™s ability to correctly identify Pedestrian Traffic Light (PTL) signals, even under challenging conditions. We developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict PTL colors, specifically tailored to street conditions in Japan. The model was trained on a dataset that considered the unique visual challenges of Japanese crosswalks. This work was published at the 25th IEEE International Multitopic Conference, showcasing the application of CNNs in real-time decision-making for robotic control. Our research aimed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of convolutional neural networks in urban environments.
