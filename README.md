# Does your robot know when to cross the road? (Published at the 25th IEEE International Multitopic Conference)

Overview: In this research project, my team and I focused on enhancing a robot’s ability to correctly identify Pedestrian Traffic Light (PTL) signals, even under challenging conditions. We developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict PTL colors, specifically tailored to street conditions in Japan. The model was trained on a dataset that considered the unique visual challenges of Japanese crosswalks. This work was published at the 25th IEEE International Multitopic Conference, showcasing the application of CNNs in real-time decision-making for robotic control. Our research aimed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of convolutional neural networks in urban environments.

Aim: Improve a model’s ability to interpret Japanese pedestrian traffic lights (PTLs) in adverse conditions

Action: Identified 16 adverse condition categories in the existing dataset and manually acquired 1072 new, labelled images for 10 categories. Trained a CNN based deep learning model on the improved dataset using PyTorch to enhance PTL colour classification in challenging conditions like poor lighting, snow etc.

Outcomes: Research paper published at the 25th IEEE International Multitopic Conference
